1. `jupyter notebook` error after installing ROOT 6.26.10
   
   Following error was faced after trying to open jupyter notebook post ROOT 6.26.10 installation
   ```

   PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/shubhamdutta/Applications/Package_install/root-6.26.10/etc/notebook/migrated'
   ```
   CAUSE: The cause of the error is `thisroot.sh`, which is sourced when terminal launches, sets the variables `JUPYTER_PATH` and `JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR`. This was not    done/present in the earlier versions of ROOT. As a result, when jupyter is trying to launch it encounters a conflict. 
  
   SOLUTION: This is a stop gap solution. I have commented the lines in `thisroot.sh` that modifies `JUPYTER_PATH` and `JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR`, thus avoiding the conflict. In    case some other issue is faced in the future by ROOT, it should be checked whether this is the cause of it or not.
